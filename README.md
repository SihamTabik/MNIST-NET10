# MNIST-NET10
This complex heterogenous fusion is composed of two heterogenous ensembles FS1 and FS2:

FS1 (CapsNet|MCDNN|DropConnect_2|CapsNet|MCDNN| DropConnect_1|DropConnect_2|Network3|Dropconnect_2) can be built using this codes:
1. Pre-trained CapsNet downloaded from: 

https://github.com/Sarasra/models/tree/master/research/capsules

2. MCDNN network was obtained from:

https://github.com/xanwerneck/ml_mnist

3. Network3 with data augmentation

4. DropConect with data augmentation


FS2 (ECOC|PrE|MLPâ†’LS|MLP) can be built using this codes:

1. CapsNet as data transformer from: 

https://github.com/Sarasra/models/tree/master/research/capsules

2. The needed codes (in Matlab) are available from:
